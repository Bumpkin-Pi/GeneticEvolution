The Code writen for my (unfinished) EQP.

Simulates a population made up of predator and prey entites with "genetics" that deside how they behave based on a small neural network.

There is actual documentation for this somewhere, but this is not a project I plan on finishing, and was mostly just a simple-ish project to get a good grade in my EPQ, which I ended up not doing anyway. 
It is only on github for backups sake. The code is very messy and rushed.
